This project is a simple rule-based chatbot created using Python as part of Task 8: Build a Chatbot using if-else. The objective of the project is to help learners understand the basic structure of Natural Language Processing (NLP) through a rule-driven approach using simple if-elif-else conditions and input/output loops.

The chatbot is designed to respond to common greetings like "hi", "hello", and "hey", as well as to basic questions such as "What is your name?", "How are you?", and "What can you do?". When a user interacts with the chatbot, the program evaluates the input and returns predefined responses based on hardcoded conditions. If the chatbot does not understand the user's input, it responds with a generic message indicating that it doesnâ€™t know how to reply. The conversation can be ended at any time by typing "bye", "exit", or "quit", after which the chatbot gracefully exits with a goodbye message.

To run the chatbot, users must have Python installed on their system. They can simply open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the chatbot.py script, and execute it using the python chatbot.py command. This will start an interactive chat session in the terminal.

The project is intentionally simple and does not rely on any external libraries, making it a great starting point for beginners. It introduces core programming concepts like conditional statements, string handling, and user interaction via the console. While basic, this chatbot serves as a foundational step towards understanding more complex NLP and AI-based chatbot systems that utilize machine learning or third-party frameworks like NLTK, spaCy, Rasa, or Dialogflow.

Overall, this chatbot project demonstrates how to simulate human-like conversation using Python's basic control structures, and it offers a practical entry point into the world of conversational AI.
